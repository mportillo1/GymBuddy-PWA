## Technical Details
- **Firebase Integration**:
  - Firebase Firestore is used for online storage of workout logs.
  - Data in Firebase uses unique identifiers to prevent conflicts during synchronization.
- **IndexedDB Integration**:
  - IndexedDB is used to store workout logs offline.
  - Data in IndexedDB syncs with Firebase when the app goes online.
- **Data Synchronization**:
  - The app detects online/offline status and toggles storage between Firebase and IndexedDB.
  - Upon reconnecting, offline data stored in IndexedDB is uploaded to Firebase to maintain consistency.
